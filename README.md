This is the source code for my personal website. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- 'index.html': The main landing page of the website.
- 'styles.css': Contains all the CSS styles used across the website.
- 'script.js': Contains JavaScript code that's responsible for handling user interactions like the navigation menu.
