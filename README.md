# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website. It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have a modern web browser (like Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari) installed on your machine.

### Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- index.html: The main landing page of the website.
- styles.css: Contains all the CSS styles used across the website.
- script.js: Contains JavaScript code that's responsible for handling user interactions like the navigation menu.
